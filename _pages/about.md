Hello! I'm Nick Brown, a data scientist in Chicago, unraveling the mysteries of marketing with causal inference.

I'm currently at [Haus](https://www.haus.io), a startup empowering businesses to measure the true impact of their marketing efforts. Here, I'm building tools to automate analysis for our science team, allowing them to tackle more complex problems. 

Away from the keyboard, I'm a music and movie buff, fueled by the Grateful Dead and John Carpenter's chilling films. I also enjoy watching the NBA as well as Seattle sports.

If you're curious about causal inference in marketing, the latest Python libraries, or just want to geek out over great music and movies, hit me up!
