Hello! I'm Nick Brown, an applied scientist in Chicago, focused on causal inference.

I'm currently at [Haus](https://www.haus.io), a startup empowering businesses to measure the true impact of their marketing efforts. Here, I'm building tools to automate analysis for our science team, allowing them to tackle more complex problems. 

Outside of my job, I'm a music and movie buff, and love the Grateful Dead and John Carpenter's films. I also enjoy watching the NBA as well as Seattle sports.
